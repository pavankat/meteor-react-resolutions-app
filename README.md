with meteor 1.3 - we can use npm packages

npm init

npm install --save react
npm install --save react-dom

now we install flow-router from atmosphere - which is Meteor's packages

you can find this command from the meteor atmosphere site atmospherejs.com/kadira/flow-router

meteor add kadira:flow-router

after this is done, you can see it in the packages file of the .meteor folder

npm install --save react-mounter
